Install
-------
Use CMake to compile and install Sorcer:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

If an error saying "package NTK not found" occurs, it means the development
files for NTK are not present. The following will download the source for
NTK and install it:
```
git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/non/fltk.git ntk
# or from here; https://git.kx.studio/non/ntk

cd ntk
./waf configure --prefix=/usr
./waf
./waf install
```

Running
-------
After the INSTALL step Ardour3, QTractor, and any other LV2 host should
automatically find Sorcer, and add it to the list of loadable plugins.

If you have the JALV LV2 host installed, the "run.sh" script can be used to
launch Sorcer as a standalone JACK client.

$  ./run.sh

Details
-------
I've removed the dependency on FAUST to install: the generated CPP file is
included in the repo now. To tweak the FAUST code, just edit faust/main.dsp.

Use FAUST with the following command to generate the next .cpp file:
```
faust main.dsp > main.cpp
```

See the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the top directory for instructions on how to
re-compile with the modified FAUST code.
